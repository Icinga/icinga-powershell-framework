### Bugfixes

* [#206](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/206) Fixes background service check daemon for collecting metrics over time which will no longer share data between configured checks which might cause higher CPU load and a possible memory leak
* [#208](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/208) Fixes `Convert-IcingaPluginThresholds` which sometimes did not return proper numeric usable values for our internal functions, causing issues on plugin calls.

## 1.2.0 (2020-08-28)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/7?closed=1)

### Upgrading Notes

#### Breaking change with non-equal versions

Check Command configuration generated by Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 require Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 or later deployed on all systems, otherwise you will run into issues with an unknown command `Exit-IcingaPluginNotInstalled` error.

* To properly catch errors on check execution you will have to import check commands as Director basket again by using `Get-IcingaCheckCommandConfig`. Further details can be found in the [upgrading docs](01-Upgrading.md)

### Notes

* Improved documentation for plenty of Cmdlets and functionality
* We have updated the handling for plugin outputs which will now only print `non Ok` values by using verbosity 0 on check plugin configuration and include `Ok` checks for packages with `non Ok` checks on verbosity 1.

## 1.1.0 (2020-06-02)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/4?closed=1)

### Notes

* [#62](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/issues/62) Deprecates `--key` argument for certificate generation for Icinga 2.12.0 and later

### Deprecations

* The value `latest` for the installation wizard argument `AgentVersion` is deprecated and has been replaced by `release`

### Breaking changes

* The `-AcceptConnections` argument for the install wizard had the opposite effect in the previous versions. Please review your configuration on a test setup before proceeding with a mass-rollout to ensure the Agent behaves as expected
* The wizard now ships with a new argument `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig` which will convert hostnames or FQDN entries for connection information to IP addresses. If you are having a CLI string available and neither want to be asked this question or change current behaviour, set the argument to 0: `-ConvertEndpointIPConfig 0`

Please be aware that because of possible changes your old custom variables containing arguments and thresholds might not apply due to new custom variable naming and handling. Please ensure to have a backup of your Icinga Director before applying any changes
