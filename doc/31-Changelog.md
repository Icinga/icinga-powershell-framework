[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/11?closed=1)

### Breaking Changes

There are changes made to the pre-compiled configuration files and `Get-IcingaCheckCommandConfig.` Please have a look on the [upgrading](30-upgrading-framework.md) before applying the new configuration files.

### Enhancements

* [#180](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/180) Ensure check data are separated from each thread and not accessible from one thread to another to prevent conflicting results
* [#193](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/193) Adds optional support for adding milliseconds to `Get-IcingaUnixTime` with the `-Milliseconds` argument for more detailed time comparison
* [#198](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/198) Adds support to flush the content of the Icinga Agent API directory with a single Cmdlet `Clear-IcingaAgentApiDirectory`
* [#203](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/203) Removes experimental state of the Icinga PowerShell Framework code caching and adds docs on how to use the feature
* [#205](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/205) Ensure Icinga for Windows configuration file is opened as read-only for every single task besides actually modifying configuration content
* [#207](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/pull/207) Adds new Argument `-LabelName` to `New-IcingaCheck`, allowing the developer to provide custom label names for checks and override the default based on the check name.

## 1.2.0 (2020-08-28)

[Issue and PRs](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-framework/milestone/7?closed=1)

### Upgrading Notes

#### Breaking change with non-equal versions

Check Command configuration generated by Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 require Icinga for Windows 1.2.0 or later deployed on all systems, otherwise you will run into issues with an unknown command `Exit-IcingaPluginNotInstalled` error.
