    # TODO: Add a cache for our Performance Counters to only fetch them once
    #       for each session to speed up the loading. This cold be something like
    #       this:
    #
    # $Global:Icinga.Private.PerformanceCounter.Cache += $CounterResult;

    # Above we initialise ever single counter and we only require a sleep once
    # in case a new, yet unknown counter was added
    if ($RequireSleep) {
        Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500;

        # Agreed, this is some sort of code duplication but it wouldn't make
        # any sense to create a own function for this. Why are we doing
        # this anyway?
        # Simple: In case we found counters which have yet not been initialised
        #         we did this above. Now we have waited 500 ms to receive proper
        #         values from these counters. As the previous generated result
        #         might have contained counters with 0 results, we will now
        #         check all counters again to receive the proper values.
        #         Agreed, might sound like a overhead, but the impact only
        #         applies to the first call of the module with the counters.
        #         This 'duplication' however decreased the execution from
        #         certain modules from 25s to 1s on the first run. Every
        #         additional run is then being executed within 0.x s
        #         which sounds like a very good performance and solution
