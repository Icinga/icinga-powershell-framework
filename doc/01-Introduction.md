Introduction
===

This PowerShell Framework will provide a collection of Cmdlets to entirely manage an Icinga 2 Agent setup and provide check plugins to fetch information from Windows hosts.

It will ensure all required Icinga configurations are handled and present and offer an easy way to extend the monitoring with custom plugins. The framework will provide a standardised set of Cmdlets, Tools and Providers to make daily work, integrations and testing available to everyone, regardless if you are a Developer, System Engineer or enthusiast.

The following requirements have to be fullfilled:

* Windows 7 / Windows 2008 R2 or later
* PowerShell Version 4.x or higher

If you are ready to get started, take a look at the [Installation Guide](02-Installation.md).
