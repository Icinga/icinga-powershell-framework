# Icinga for Windows Knowledge Base

While using Icinga for Windows you might run into issues, permissions problems or different problems during usage. Our main goal is to catch all of those problems and print proper error messages to give ideas on what went went wrong exactly.

However, some problems might be more complex and require further detailed descriptions as an issue could be caused my multiple different events or possible solutions would be way too long to put into a plugin output for example.

For this reason you will find a list of Icinga knowledge base entries below. Entries are assigned a unique 6 digit number referenced by issue messages, lead by the abbreviation `IWKB`. Example `IWKB000001`.
